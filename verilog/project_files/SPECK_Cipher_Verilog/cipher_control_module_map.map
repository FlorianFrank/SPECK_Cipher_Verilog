ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 1,068 out of  54,576    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               1,068
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      1,472 out of  27,288    5%
    Number used as logic:                    1,472 out of  27,288    5%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,400
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   72
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       192 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,517
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           451 out of   1,517   29%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  45 out of   1,517    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,021 out of   1,517   67%
    Number of unique control sets:              22
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              28 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
